### This repository is used for keeping track of the operation of CeNCOOS infrastructure and data products 
The repository consists of various scripts for each CeNCOOS system that needs to be monitored. This operations tracking is ultimately published on this webpage: [https://www.cencoos.org/operations-dashboard/](https://www.cencoos.org/operations-dashboard/) 

**The types of datastreams that this code is currently checking regularly include:**
- CeNCOOS funded shore stations
- Regional model outputs
- High Frequency Radar products
- CalHABMAP sampling
- Imaging FlowCytobots (IFCBs)
- Gliders
- National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Buoys
- Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) Buoys
- Data products developed in-house
- Matlab scripts managed by Fred Bahr

**There are two main steps for deploying this product.**
1. Fecthing the most recent data for each dataset and producing csv outputs. <br>
This step is run on an MBARI virtual machine, whereby the file `scripts/update_aggrid.csh` is run hourly as a cron job. This shell script runs various Python scripts, the end products of which include the generation of csv files published to the `csv_outputs` directory. These csv files then get sent to the CeNCOOS webserver using Secure Copy Protocol (scp).<br><br>
2. Generating interactive tables and deploying them to a Wordpress webpage. <br>
JavaScript files are being run on the CeNCOOS webserver (located in `/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/cencoos/js`) to generate interactive tables with content from the csv outputs - an example of one of these files is found in the `ag_grid/` directory of this repo. <br>
Once a .js file is generated for each data type, the `functions.php` file is updated on the webserver. Adding a new function here allows the new .js file to be recognized and included in the webpage. 

**The directory structure is as follows:**
- `ag_grid` : JavaScript code to produce an interactive table for each datastream type using [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/), containing information about system status. This code is deployed on the CeNCOOS webserver.

- `csv_output` : csv files that are updated regularly (hourly) with information about system status, to be fed into the AG-Grid. These csv files are produced on the concave virtual machine managed by MBARI.

- `gsheet` : contains a JSON file and a Python script for accessing comments populated in a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-HcKNYpRJmm41R9zXwUGOvWBo917Kh_1t_FLRAH9UlQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Information from this spreadsheet is added as a column in several tables on the operations dashboard to provide more context as to why a system may be down.

- `json_files` : several JSON files used to access data fom each datatype, with dataset names and end-point information for fetching most recent data. 

- `scripts` : Python and bash scripts used for generating status csv files for different datastream types. 

- `testing` : various scripts and jupyter notebooks used for testing different stages in the pipeline.
